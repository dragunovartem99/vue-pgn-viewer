# Vue PGN Viewer

Vue 3 wrapper around official [**Lichess PGN Viewer**](https://github.com/lichess-org/pgn-viewer)

> [!NOTE]
> PGN viewer widget is designed to be embedded in content pages.  
> This won't replace a fully featured analysis board.

For more dynamic approach, you should look in this directions:
- [lichess-org/chessground](https://github.com/lichess-org/chessground)
- [qwerty084/vue3-chessboard](https://github.com/qwerty084/vue3-chessboard), which is a wrapper around "chessground"
